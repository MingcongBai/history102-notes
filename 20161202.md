1970s: The Decade of Malaise
----------------------------

- Watergate Hotel (1972)
- Church Committee (1975, 1976)
- Paris Peace Accords (1973)
- Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (1973)
- Paul Volcker (1979)
- Iran Hostage Crisis (1979)

The 70s is often characterized as a decade of decline - in material, political, and geopolitical sense, caused by scandals in the government. The trust in U.S. government dropped for people both within and outside of the United States. Military decline was also prominent, especially in the defeat in Vietnam - bringing much to shock.

Watergate Hotel (1972)
----------------------

Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. was the headquarters for the Democratic National Committee. Nixon's "plumbers" - a group tasked with illegal surveillance, broke in to steal records. Buglars were arrested, and testified that Nixiojn was complicit in their activities. Nixon tried to stonewall investigation by encouraging his men to perjure themselves.

Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v. Nixon that the President could not withhold Whitehouse tapes. Nixon resigned after they were released - or in his lack of faith in surviving the Congress Impeachment - proving his involvement in such illegal activities.

This scandal eroded faith in government by the people by significant magnitude.

Church Committee
----------------

Congressional Committee led by Democrat Frank Church that investigated abuses of power by CIA - founded after investigative reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that CIA had been involved in illegal spying.

Concluded that CIA had acted as if it was above the law, conducting illegal survellance at home and assassination attemps abroad. Concluded with the creation of a permeant Congressional Committee to oversee intelligence agencies.

Fall of Saigon
--------------

In Paris Peace Accords, signed by Nixon in 1973, United States agreed to withdraw troops from South Vietnam. Althought the Viet Cong agreed to cease hostilities, they in fact continued largely unabated.

In 1975, Saigon fell and communists took control over South Vietnam.

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
---------------------------------------------

In 1973 OPEC countries began to reduce oil exports by 5% every month, in response to U.S. aid to Israel. By December, they ended exports to the U.S. altogether.

This in turn created the oil crysis and a massive inflation. This also contributed to "stagflation" and national crisis of confidence.

Paul Volcker
------------

An economist appointed by Reagan to serve as Chairman the Federal Reserve in 1979. Significantly increased interest rates to lower supply of money and combat inflation.

Volcker's policies created a temporary spike in unemployment, which hurt Carter politically.

Led to increasing acceptance of conservative monetarist thought, popularized by Milton Friedman, which argued tthat the economy could be stablilized by monitoring the supply of money. This contrasted with Keynesianism, which in emphasized the importance of government spending, and was generally perceived as more liberal.

Iran Hostage Crisis
-------------------

In 1979, Iranians staged a religious revolution, in which the secular American ally, the Shah, was overturned. Carter allowed the Shah to take refuge in the United States.

In retaliation, Iranians attacked the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans captive, holding them from November 4th, 1979 until January 20th, 1981. Fostered the impression that Carter was a weak President and that American gobal power was on the decline.
