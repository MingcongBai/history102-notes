What is the New Left?
---------------------

In contrast to the "Old Left", labor unions, socialism, communism... Calls for social reforms, and increased government control. The New Left calls for participatory democracy, "taking on the elites".

The New Left calls for individual autonomy, and pushing the boundaries of what could be done and accepted by an individual. Often times characterized with the Anti-Vietnam War protests of the period.

Students for a Democratic Society
---------------------------------

Developed out of the League for Industrial Democracy and became the leading organization of the New Left movement.

Was established as a separate organization at a meeting in Ann Arbor - in the year of 1962, releasing the "Port Huron Statement" as its statement of principles. Denounced Cold War and called for participatory democracy to undermine the power elite.

Influenced by the idea of C. Wright Mills and the leadership of Tom Hayden.

Also criticized the system of unions, which they believed to be incorporated into the "governmental system" - making it ineffective in challenging the establishment.

Also belived that the Cold War was used by the United States government to prevent radical discussion of politics and actions of that fashion.

Members, especially leaders are commonly found to be originated from progressive families, in which discontent grew over time in the feeling that their parents were not pushing "hard enough" for social changes - especially in the matter of Jim Crow (recall).
