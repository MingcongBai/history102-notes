Richard Nixon and the Splintering of the Democratic Coalition
-------------------------------------------------------------

- George Wallace (1968)
- The Silent Majority (1968)
- The Environment Protection Agency (1970)
- Milliken v. Bradley (1974)
- Détente (1972)
- *The Pentagon Papers* (1971)

George Wallace
--------------

As Governor of Alabama, he stood in front of University of Alabama in 1963, to prevent balck students from integrating the institution - against order of the Federal government, and standing opposite to a National Guard officer.

Ran in 1968 by appealing to opposition to integration and "law and order".

Emblematic of divisions within the Democratic party that Nixon would exploit.

*"And it is a sad day in our country that you cannot walk even in your neighborhood at night or even in the daytime because both national parties, in the last number of years, have kowtowed to every group or anarchists that have roamed the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and throughout the country..."*

Silent Majority
---------------

Nixon's most popular campaign slogan.

Referred t othe idea that protesters had taken center stage because they were disruptive, but that the vast majority of Americans disagreed with them. Real majority in America had more traditional American values and were being neglected by the press and politicians.

Nixon will later go on and propose many liberal economical and labor relation legislations, many did not pass - while a large number still did. Notably the Occupational Safety and Health Act which mandated employers to ensure safety of workers - some terms mandated health insurance purchase for employees.

Environmental Protection Agency
-------------------------------

Grew oiut of Earth Day movement. Twenty million participated in Earth Day on April 22nd, 1970, after Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed a national teach in on the environment.

Reflected concerns about the effect of toxic chemicals on ecology.

Created thousands of new regulations that limited the types of chemicals that could be used by both businesses and consumers. **Excemplary of Nixon's willingness to work with liberals** - however, believed to be due to the less radical nature of environmental movements.

*"EPA estimate 25 MPG highway..."*

This required a massive expansion of the Federal Government with thousands of new regulations in focus of environmental protection.

Milliken v. Bradley
-------------------

Nixon appointed four Supreme Court Justics in his tensure.

New justices ruled that municipalities were not obligated to bus students from district to create racial parity. Nixon's fight against "forced" busing helped to endear him to democrats upset about civil rights.

Emblematic of his *"Southern Strategy"* of slowing down integration process in the South - even at cost of firing those who pushed for such process - to win support from white voters who believed against integration.

Détente
-------

 Nixon travelled to China for 10 days in 1972, metting Mao. The American government recognized Communist China for the first time since the revolution of 1945 - and agreed to pull troops out of Taiwan. As a result, China normalized relationship with the United States.

 Subsequently, the Soviet Union sought to meet with Nixon, so as not be outmaneuvered by China. Signed SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks), in both the United States and Russia agreed to limit their arsenal.

 Nixon's credentials as an anti-communist helped him to ease tensions with the Communist world.

Kent State Massacre
-------------------

*"The Kent State shootings (also known as the May 4 massacre or the Kent State massacre) occurred at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, in the United States and involved the shooting of unarmed college students by the Ohio National Guard on Monday, May 4, 1970. There were 28 soldiers who admitted to firing on top of the hill, 25 of these soldiers fired 55 rounds into the air and into the ground, two of the soldiers fired .45cal pistol shots, three into the crowd, and three into the air, one soldier fired birdshot into the air (James Russell was also hit with a shotgun's birdshot, some believe that some of the shot may have ricocheted off a tree and hit him). The guardsmen fired 67 rounds over a period of 13 seconds, killing four students and wounding nine others, one of whom suffered permanent paralysis."*
