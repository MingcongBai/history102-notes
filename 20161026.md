The Solid South and the New Deal
--------------------------------

- Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934
- Black Cabinet
- Missouri ex. Rel. Gaines V. Canada (1938)
- Gavagan Bill (1937)
- Fair Labor Standards Act (1940)

The 21st Amendment
------------------

Enacted in 1933.

Roosevelt campaigned on an end to prohibition and in his first hundred days passed a bill moderating the Volstead Act. This represented an end to the culture wars of the 1920s. Seemed to validate urban immigrants, who had long opposed prohibition.

The Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934
---------------------------------

Fullfilled long term southern objective of reducing tariffs on manufactured good. Allowed the President to negotiate trade deals with other countries, giving Congress the power only to vote it up or down. This reduced the power of groups lobbying for protection.

A major landmark in the development of globalization.

Note: this act did not suggest any form in reduction of tariff, but rather, the process of tariff set-ups.

Purge of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration
---------------------------------------------------

The AAA left many predominately African-American tenant farmers unemployed, because land owners were paid not to farm, but their land.

A group of liberals in the AAA, led by Rexofrd Tugwell, lobbied to give some of the AAA subsidies to tenant farmers - in 1935, AAA officials who lobbied for payments to tenant farmer were fired (pure of the AAA).

Wage Differentials
------------------

NRA minimum wage laws did not apply to most jobs performed by African-Americans in the South. NRA established wage differentials between Southern and the Norhtern industrial labor, but th elower southern rates were typically assigned to African-Americans, and higher Northern rates typically assigned to white workers, regardless of where they were working.

Similar wage differentials were used by programs like the CCC.

Agricultural and Domestic Service Exemptions
--------------------------------------------

- Most New Deal labor law excluded agricultural and domestic workers, sectors dominated by African Americans.
- Exemptions written into the NRA, the Social Security Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act (recall, the union permission) did not apply to agricultural industries as a result - to prevent organization of labors.

Black Cabinet
-------------

A group of prominent black leaders who were appointed to prominent jobs throughout the federal government.

Elanor Roosevelt encouraged them to meet, discuss issues and communicate concerns to the administration.

Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada
-----------------------------------

Built off of Thurgood Marshall's (first African American supreme justice) victory in Murray V. Pearson.

Supreme Court integrated University of Missouri's Law School and implied that all other state facilitates that were not equal, must be integrated. Heighted cocerns among southerners that NAACP would use the court system to affect integration, causing discontent with Roosevelt's Judiciary Reorganization Bill.

Gavagan Bill
------------

Northern Democrats voted in large numbers of a bill to make lynching a federal crime. Republican Senators supported a filibuster by Southern Democrats to block the bill in the Senate.

The bill was passed in 1937 after all.

Represents Northern Democrats shift toward racial liberalism,a nd an emergent alliance between Southern Democrats and Republicans.

### *Lynching*

*verb.*

*(of a mob) kill (someone), especially by hanging, for an alleged offense with or without a legal trial.*

Fair Labor Standard Act
-----------------------

Last major piece of New Deal legislation - re-established many of the labor regulations of the NRA, like the forty hour work week, bans on child labor, and minimum wages.

Opposed strongly by Southern congressmen, afraid that it would empower black laboreres. Represented split of Southern congressmen from the New Deal.

**Did not cover farm laborers or domestic servants, industries which most souther blacks worked in.**
