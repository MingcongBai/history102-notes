The Election of 1912, Woodrow Wilson, and Progressive Era Radicalism
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pinchot=Ballinger Controversy (1909-1910)
- Mann-Elkins Act (1910)
- *"The New Nationalism"* (1910)
- Underwood Tariff Act (1913)
- Federal Reserve Act (1914)
- Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914)
- US Commission on Industry Relations (1914)
- Adamson Act (1916)

The Election of 1912
--------------------

One of the more radical elections in the United States' history, according to some.

Woodrow Wilson had an idea that monopolies must be eradicated in favor of civil development, and argued that the government should play a smaller role in economy. Radical ideas about redistribution of wealth.

William Howard Taft
-------------------

Regarded to have betrayed the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, for being no more progressive than Roosevelt.

In fact, that wasn't necessarily true:

- In his first term, he had created twice as many anti-trust lawsuits.
- More national parks was established in his term.
- Income tax became constitutional (16th Amendment).
- Direct election of senators (17th Amendment).
- Campaign Finance Act (disclosure of party spendings).
- Regulation of communications company in their standards (ICC, and wave frequencies).

### Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy

Theordore Roosevelt's chief forester, Gifford Pinchot accused Taft's Secretary of Interior, Ricard Ballinger, of selling off coal land in Alaska as part of corrupt deal. Taft, disapproved of the arguments under his own administration, he fired Pinchot.

He fired Pinchot for making these claims created in the impression that Taft was splitting with Roosevelt.

There was no proof of impropriety but the controversy suggested to many that Taft was reversing Roosevelt's policies of conservation, and working for elite interests.

### Roosevelt and Taft

Roosevelt's largest disagreement with Taft was perhaps the difference in policies regarding monopolies. While Roosevelt targeted only "bad" monopolies, Taft with his background with law, disagreed with Roosevelt's way of deciding good from bad (or vice versa), broken up "too many" as Roosevelt stated.

*"The New Nationalism"*
-----------------------

Delivered by Theodore Roosevelt in 1910, at the site of John Brown Memorial in Osawatomie, Kansas.

*"Combinations in industry are the result of an imperative economic law which cannot be repealed by political legislation. The effor at prohibiting all combination has substantially failed. The way out lies, not in attempting to prevent such combinations, but in completely controlling them in the interest of the public welfare. For that purpose the Federal Bureau of Corporations is an agency of the first as well as that of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and should be largely increased."*

- Large national corporations under control of the Federal Government.
- Radicalism in reforming national economics and regulations.

Woodrow Wilson
--------------

Former president of Princeton University. Served a short term as governor in New Jersy, for the North still being largely republican, the fact that he won a state in such territory was a prevelant representation of his political abilities.

*"There is one proposition upon which this campaign turns... That proposition is this: that monopoly is inevitable. That is what some of the people who want us to adopt a certain purpose maintain, and that is what I deny. If monopoly is inevitable, then the thing to do is for the government to take hold of monopoly and regulate it. If monopoly is not inevitable, then the thing for law to do is to break it up and prevent is forming again, I believe that monopoly can be broken up. If I didn't believe it, I would know that all the roads of free devvelopment were shut in this country."*

Federal Reserve Act
-------------------

Before this act, after the Civil War, banks were allowed to print money (if permitted by a charter). The Federal Reserve Act limited the printing of money to 14 regional banks (but not a national bank, decentralized).

Clayton Anti-Trust Act
----------------------

*"An important difference between the Clayton Act and its predecessor, the Sherman Act, is that the Clayton Act contained safe harbors for union activities. Section 6 of the Act (codified at 15 U.S.C. ยง 17) exempts labor unions and agricultural organizations, saying "that the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce, and permit[ting] labor organizations to carry out their legitimate objective". Therefore, boycotts, peaceful strikes, peaceful picketing, and collective bargaining are not regulated by this statute. Injunctions could be used to settle labor disputes only when property damage was threatened.*

*"The Supreme Court ruled in the 1922 case Federal Baseball Club v. National League that Major League Baseball was not "interstate commerce" and thus was not subject to federal antitrust law."*
