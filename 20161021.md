The Second New Deal and the Challenges to New Deal Liberalism
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Bonus Army March (1932)
- Union Party (1936)
- Revenue Act of 1935
- Social Security Act (1935)
- American Liberty League (1934)
- Schechter Poultry Corp v.s. U.S. (1935)

Threat of Authoritarian Politics
--------------------------------

From the rise of the Soviet Republics Federation of Russia in 1920's, followed by dictactorships in Western European countries - such as the attack of the Reichstadt by Adolf Hitler's National Socialist Worker's Party - the United States did not go down the path, but was by no mean immune from those threats.

Recall, the call for abolishment of the Congress.

The Great Depression and Personal Ills
--------------------------------------

The Superman comics, first published in the 1930's, was a embodiment of the ideal characters in public minds then. Especially to males, who were not able to support their family (or even committed suicide for the insurance money - to be left to his family).

Superman's struggle largely reflected on the period:

- Fighting against dictactorships and Fascism regimes;
- Fighting against monopolies and "bad businessmen";
- Fighting against Third World authoritarian regimes;

Bonus Army March
----------------

In summer of 1932, 43000 veterans of World War I marched on Washington D.C., demanding early payment of their bonuses. Hoover decided to crack down on the protest - firing gas and bullet at the the crowd.

Father Charles Coughlin
-----------------------

Priest based out of Detroit, Michigan. Led radio show that tens of millions of Americans listened to by the time - forming large public influences.

- Attacked banks and alleged that the New Deal represented a conspiracy led by financial elites, communists, and Jews.
- His sermons pit elites of big government and big business against the "common man".

Huey Long
---------

Governor and Senator from Louisiana. Proposed the *"Share Our Wealth"* program, which called for the cofiscation of all income over one million dollars. Used violence, patronage, and corruption to maintain an iron fisted control over the State of Louisiana.

Dr. Francis Townsend
--------------------

A physician who promised to give every America older than 60 $200 month. Ten million Americans signed petition supporting his plan (in perspective, 15 million American voted for President Hoover in his election).

The plan was flawed, however, as being over-simplified and inconsiderate at a larger scale.

The Union Party
---------------

Formed in 1936 to challenge the New Deal, led by Father Coughlin, Gerald Smith, and Francis Townsend. Nominated Congressman William Lemke for President.

Forced Roosevelt to embrace a series of reforms that came to be known as the "Second New Deal".

Note: Huey Long was assassinated before he would be able to stage a campaign for Presidency.

The Revenue Act of 1935
-----------------------

Increated income tax **drastically**, to rate as high as 75%, Roosevelt attacked the rich as "economic royalists" when proposing the bill. New Dealers claimed that the law was "stealing Huey Long's thunder".

*"These ecnomoic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power. Our alligiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power. In vain they seek to hid behind the Flags of the Constitution stand for. Now, as always, they stand for democracy, not tyranny; for freedom, not subjection; and against a dictactorship by mob rule and the over-privileged alike."*

Schechter Poultry Corp v.s. U.S.
--------------------------------

Overturned the NRA because it attempted to regulate commerce within states, where as the constitution only gave the federal government power over interstate trade. Inspired Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Court with the Judicial Reorganization Act.
