Conservatism Ascendant
----------------------

- Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)
- Persian Gulf War (1991)
- Democratic Leadership Council (1985)
- Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (1996)

*"In today's lecture we are going to discuss George Bush... To George Bush!"*

George H. W. Bush would often criticize Ronald Reagan's economical and taxation reforms (recall, Voodoo Economics, or Reaganomics). But in his campaign in 1988, he would protrait himself as a "favored son" of Ronald Reagan, he attempted to follow Reagan's steps in politics - although in a more moderated fashion.

However, it is also important to note that it is very difficult to go along a political path or with a policy in changing circumstances. George H. W. Bush was sometimes regarded even higher than Ronald Reagan - especially in his policies with taxes. More details below.

George H. W. Bush is also the President in whose term the world witnessed the end to the Cold War - although arguably Ronald Reagan was the true pusher, in foreign politics' sense.

And also notably, although in George H. W. Bush's term, unemployment rate increased again (from 1988 to 1993) - note that Ronald Reagan's term witnessed mostly drops in unemployment - but in his later half in Presidency unemployment rate did decrease significantly.

Americans with Disabilities Act
-------------------------------

Signed by George Bush in 1990.

This act banned discrimination in employment and public accommodations to people with disabilities. Created regulations that required all new constructions to be handicapped accessible.

Expanded the power of the federal government in ways that were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which had been opposed by conservatives (note the shift in policies).

Persian Gulf War
----------------

In 1990, the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded his oil rich neighbour of Kuwait.

George Bush organized international consortium to "liberate" Kuwait, arguing that the international community should protect the independence of small nations. Persian Gulf War began in 1991, ending after only 42 days.

(Note that Soviet Union was too busy dealing with domestic political crises at this time.)

Reduced "Vietnam War Syndrome," paving the way for the populatrity for future foreign (military) interventions. Although it is also most important to note the perspective on this issue - say, American Imperialism.

Democratic Leaders Conncil
--------------------------

Founded after Ronald Reagan's landslide win in 1984.

Sought to make the Democratic Party viable again by moving toward more free market ideology, while taking a moderate stance on social issues that would bring pre-Moral Majority Republicans over to the Democratic Party.

Published the *Mainstream Democrat*. Bill Clinton was the chair of the DLC until he resigned to run for President in 1992.

(Note: "Bill" is not Bill Clinton's legal first name, William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton)

Personal Responsiblity and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
--------------------------------------------------------------

Clinton fulfilled promise to "end welfare as we know it".

- Placed limits on the length of time that recipients could draw on welfare (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) to prevent lifelong dependency.
- Recipients were permitted to receive no more than 5 years of welfare during the course of their life and no more than 2 consecutive years.

Devolved much of the administration of welfare to the states, which were permitted to set shorter benefit periods, States were also permitted mandate that beneficiaries demonstrate efforts in labor (GRE, proof of part time labor/jobs).

Bill Clinton's Legislations
---------------------------

*"Don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) was the official United States policy on military service by gays, bisexuals, and lesbians, instituted by the Clinton Administration on February 28, 1994, when Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 issued on December 21, 1993, took effect, lasting until September 20, 2011. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service."*

A large amount of new federal crime was also added to laws, moreover, put in great effort in preventing hate crimes.

George W. Bush
--------------

George W. Bush would succeed Bill Clinton, he would be known of his very aggressive foreign policies (Invasion of Iraq) and his strong emphasis on nationalism. Wilsonianism would be largely reflected in his actions to "bring democracy to Iraq".

His approval rate was also significantly boosted with his political and military reactions to the September 11th (2001) terrorist attack.
