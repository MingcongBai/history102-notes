Anti-Communism and the Beginning of Cold War
--------------------------------------------

- Postdam Conference (1945)
- X-Article (1947)
- Truman Doctrine (1947)
- Marshall Plan (1948)
- Alger Hiss
- Millard Tydings
- Taft Hartley Act (1947)

The rise of American military in the global scale - before the Cold War began, the American military only held little standing army. Although in World War I, American formed a large standing army - it dissolved soon after the war.

World War II, America would not shrink in its military scale, in fear of Soviet influence. William Jennings Bryan was against a large army, as it might imply lack of democracy in the future - "a war that would eventually come back home".

Europe After the Postdam Conference
-----------------------------------

Postdam followed up on Yalta Conference, dividing up Germany and ensuring that Russia did not demand reparations from Western Germany. Truman believed Stalin broke deal by refusing to offer free elections in Eastern European countries.

Represented last moment of unity between Russia and the United States.

### Iron Curtain Speech

*"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe... Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, ... I must call the Soviet Sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high, and in some cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow."*

*"... The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American Democracy. For with primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future."*

X-Article
---------

Alternatively known as the "Long Telegram". Article anonymously submitted to *Foreign Affairs* by the diplomat George Kennan.

- Argued that because Russia was isolated and feared that it was culturally inferior, it was naturally inclined to be bellicose, and even more so under communism.
- Argued that the United States would actively need to "contain" Russian's expansion in political sphere.

### Truman Doctrine

Declared that the United States woiuld work to prevent the spread of communism around the globe - in adaptation of the X-Article (or partially inspired by), an effort to prevent communism spread to Greece (initially).

This doctrine also led to the enactment of the National Security Act in 1947 - military force, CIA, and much more new infrastructure were formed.

Note: some refer this to the "containment policy".

Marshall Plan
-------------

First propsed in a speech by the Secretary of State George Marshall at Harvard University:

- Loaned 17 billion dollars to Europe over a period of 4 years, to subsidize the reconstruction of European infrastructure (especially to those the United States fought against, mostly Germany).
- Represented the commitment to prevent the expansion of communism influence in Europe.

The plan was enacted in 1948, one year after the proposal.

The Hiss Case
-------------

Investigation into Hiss led by the House of Un-American Activities Committee.

Hiss's conviction for perjury catapulted Richard Nixon to fame and depicted government elites as being of questionable loyalty.

Joseph McCarthy
---------------

*"Today we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and Christianity. The modern champions of communism have selected this as the time, and ladies and gentlemen, the chips are down - they are truly down."*

Incorporated anti-Communism into popular medias and ideas. Associated large government elites as communists. Used means of intimidation to gain public attention, did not only target the government elites and officials, but also those "in the neighbor", with any sort of anti-America sentiment or even homosexuality - which somehow was connected with Communism.

In 1954, he accused an high military official to be communist - created a backlash, President Eisenhower - an ex-military, to discredit him behind the scene. He later lost most of his own credibility in the McCarthy-Welsh Exchange - eventually censured in December of 1954.

*Unable to prove his political acquisitions.*

Millard Tydings and Earl Browder
--------------------------------

Millard Tydings was a democratic Congressman from Maryland. Tydings led committee that concluded McCarthy's claim that the State Department was full of communists was a "Fraud and a hoax".

Led investigation against Joseph McCarthy.

Fake pictures were distributed to suggest Tydings was associated with the Communist party leader Earl Browder, costing him the re-election.

Taft Hartley Act
----------------

Allows states to exempt out of the Wagner Act, which secures the right of workers to unionize if a majority at site vote in favor of a union.

Legislation was enacted based in part on the idea that the CIO had permitted communists too much influence in its organization.
