James Garfield
--------------

Assassinated by Charles Guiteau, Assassination led to the passage of the [Pendleton Act](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=48). The assassination was motivated of him refusing to give Guiteau a job, who doesn't speak French and is by no mean qualified.

Under qualified workers in the government was still normally found by the time. Civil workers were unable to be fired prior to the Pendleton Act - which established the merit-based system of selecting government officials and supervising their work.

Believed to have helped the government in becoming more effective and "clean".

*"His largest contribution was being shot."*

Henry George
------------

One of the earliest and more significant voices in pushing anarchist social system. Born in Philadelphia, worked in factory, and eventually got a job in journalism.

Borned and raised in poverty, George has great interest in technical advancement and its relation with poverty (economy progress).

"The philosophy and reform movement were known in George's time as 'Single-Tax'. His immensely popular writing is credited with sparking several reform movements of the Progressive Era and ultimately inspiring the broad economic philosophy that is today often referred to as Georgism, the main tenet of which is that people legitimately own value they fairly create, but that natural resources and common opportunities, most importantly the value of land or location, are rightfully owned in common by individuals in a community, rather than titleholders."

— *Wikipedia: Henry George*

George was accomondated by the Knights of Labor, who were inclusive of men and women, but not for "non-producers". Does not believe in wage-based labor, but instead, a commonwealth system where laboring men forms a industry.

The Knights of Labor refrained themselves from strikes and political campaigns. But later, [The Great Upheaval](http://www.ushistory.org/us/37a.asp) erupted.

Samuel Gompers and Post-KoL
---------------------------

Established the American Federation for Labors (AFL), as mostly a political, craft union.

*"The trade union movement represents the organized economic power of the workers... It is in reality the most potent and the most direct social insurance the workers can establish."*

AFL, in contrast with KoL:

- More solutional, and encourages strikes and barganing.
- Excluded people of color.
- Excluded unskilled workers (to fund for strikes).
- Excluded women.

Granger Laws
------------

Established in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota. Limited the rates that railroads could charge farmers shipping their goods.

Overturned by the Supreme Court in Wabash V. Illinois, because Interstate Congress was the domain of federal government.

*"Certain aspects of the Granger Laws varied from state to state, but all of the involved states shared the same intent: to make pricing of railroad rates more favorable to farmers, small rural farmers in particular, in the states. This common aspiration was a result of the laws being promoted heavily in state politics by the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry (Grange)."*

In 1890, the [Farmer's Aliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_Alliance) established a political platform [Ocala Demands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocala_Demands).

*"In 1892 the Farmers' Alliance founded the People's (or Populist) Party, and the Ocala Demands were incorporated in the party's Omaha Platform. As the focus of the Farmers' Movement shifted into politics, the Farmer's Alliance faded away."*

Sherman Anti-Trust Act
----------------------

The first legislature to limit sizes of business cooperation, to prevent monopoly in certain areas of business.

Made it illegal to restrict trade. In the United States vs. E. C. Knight Co. case, the Supreme Court ruled against using the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to prevent monopolies in manufacturing.

Court ultimately ruled that strikes were a restriction of trade, and used power to intervene and stop strikes with injunctions.

Pullman Strike of 1894
----------------------

Railroad workers organized by AFL walked out of their work, slowing down railroad transport to a halt. The Federal Government commanded army to intervene the situation.

Conflict between the army and strikers led to 13 deaths. Eugene Debs, the leader of this strike was imprisoned (who turned from Populist to a Marxist, who led the American Socialist movements for years to come).
