Political Economy of Gilded Age America
---------------------------------------

- Bessemer Process (1855);
- Promontory Point (1869);
- Credit Mobilier of America (1872);
- Standard Oil Company;
- Herbert Spencer (1820 - 1903);

The Guilded Age
---------------

Vanderbilt Mansion, Newport.

The gathering place for business elites, those who benefited significantly from the 19th century's economical expansion and competetion.

"Gilded Age", apparently beautiful, as stated by Mark Twain - who criticizes this period for its development gained from exploitation and political corruption as opposed to hard work and honest earning.

This economical expansion also brought by new businesses for a more vibrant capitalist market in the future.

Bessemer Converter
------------------

Bessemer process created by British inventor Henry Bessemer, could produce ~5 tons of steel at a time. Facilitated construction of many of the major products of the age, including skyscrapers and railroads.

Lowered cost in producing large amount of steel, however the machinery itself was not easily affordable.

Standard Time and the Railroads
-------------------------------

Standard times were not introduced until late 19th century which marked an end to the inaccruate time table that railroad system relied on.

Promontory Point
----------------

Location where the Union Pacific Railroad Company and Central Pacific Railroad Company met. This marked the completion of the first transcontinental railroad.

Heavily subsidized by the Federal Government with land from the public domain and direct financial aid.

The Federal Government was typically giving out financial aid for railroad construction.

However, exploiters did try to build inefficient railroad tracks for mileage, as the government pays by miles. However, given this way of construction, United States by the time had as much railroad as the rest of the world combined.

#### California Railroad Land Grants

Grants like this, however, brought concern that businesses were corrupting the government. With government applying their control upon the railroad business via land grants/taxation/legislature, the business in turn giving financial support/bribes to politicians (during their term or during elections).

Credit Mobilier Scandal
-----------------------

- Thomas Durant founded company ostensibly to construct the Union Pacific from 1863 - 1869;
- In 1872, it was revealed that he had given stock to Congressmen to get large public subsidizes;
- Represents trend toward political corruption and collusion with business;

Two Congressmen were censored and some other few were accused along. However, not much legal action was taken against them as the legislature did not suggest this as illegal by the time.

A scandal nonetheless.

Standard Oil
------------

Founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1863 with money from Union war contracts. Standard Oil pioneered in Vertical Integration, and the "Trust" in 1882.

Origin of Social Darwinism
--------------------------

*"One of the acutest metaphysicians of recent times, one of the most vigorous as well as the boldest thinker that English speculation has yet produced."*

â€” John Stuart Mill on Herbert Spencer

Spencer wrote *Social Statistics* in 1851, laying out the foundations for his philosophy of *Social Darwinism*.
