- *Feminine Mystique* (1963)
- Title VII (1964)

Intense cultural changes took place since the 60s, and throughout the 70s - the movement of Feminism was prominent in this period.

Different from the first wave feminism which asked for women empowering, the second wave asked for removal of sexual stereotypes of women - regarding their role, abilities, and characters. Jobs and certain social activities were banned for women before this movement.

*Educating Our Daughters*
-------------------------

Written by Lynn White, President of Mills College, a women's college in Oakland, California.

The book claimed that educating women frustrated them by creating expectations that could not be lived up to - suggesting the limitation in work force for female individuals.

Argued higher education for women should be geared toward traditionally feminine skills - house work, and such.

Betty Freidan
-------------

Graduated from Smith College.

Published *The Feminine Mystique* in 1963. Former writer for labor magazine. Found suburban lifestyle stifling, and coined the term "the problem that has no name" to describe discontent of affluent suburban housewives.

She argued that the lack of fulfillment felt by women is not due to the *unsuitable* jobs opportunities, but the lack of opportunities for women in occupation in general.

Helped found the National Organization For Women.

Title VII
---------

Provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned employment discrimination.

Howard Smith, a Democrat from Virginia, added a provision against discrimination on the basis of sex believed that it would give northern democrats justification not to support the Civil Rights Act.

Many Southern Democrats supported the inclusion of women with the hope that it would lead to the law being shot down, some feminists also supported it.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) *refused* to enforce law against gender discrimination, providing inspiration for the formation of NOW.

### National Organization for Women

- Brought to light the system of pregnancy leave - allowing a balance between family lives and profession.
- Also pushed for an ideal that marriage being a "true partnership between sexes".

"SNCC Position Paper, Nov. 1964."
---------------------------------

Written by Mary King and Casey Hayden. Represents sexism in New Left Movements, that ultimately pushed younger generation of women into feminism.

Aruged that gender discrimination was endemic throughout the SNCC. Leadership roles went to men, women were assigned traditionally feminine roles like clerical work. Stokley Carmichael joked in the ensuing discussion that the position of women in SNCC "was prone" (laying down) - which seemed more like a serious comment as he repeated the term in the press.

Women members protested that when women spoke in the meetings, the male members "stretched and began chatting" - and sexual issue were largely ignored in the organization. The term of sexism were not strongly regarded by male members as they refused to compare sexism with racism as a social injustice.

*Our Bodies, Ourselves*
-----------------------

Self-published by Boston Women's Health Book Collective in 1970 and produced commercially in 1973.

Tried to provide women with information about their bodies, without male doctors as intermediaries. Represents the bottom up activism of "consciousness raising" groups that made the "personal political".

Politicized women's health by making it a question of self-ownership. Coincided with Roe v. Wade (a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of abortion).

Miss America Protest of 1968
----------------------------

Protested objectification of women in Atlantic City. Origin of the stereotype of "bra burning," though no bras were actually burned at the event (what?) - they through them in "freedom cans", but actually aprons were thrown in (... Okay).

Equal Rights Amendment
----------------------

*"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the Untied States or by any state on account of sex."*

The amendment was first submitted to Congress in 1923. However, opposed by some labor unions because it would overturn special protections labor for women that had existed since Muller v. Oregon in 1908.

Phyllis Schlafly
----------------

A veteran conservative activist, who had campaigned for Barry Goldwater in 1964. Founded Stop ERA in 1972 to hinder the passage of equal rights amendment.

Argued that equal rights meant that women would lose privileges. Tapped into discontent with feminism, including women who blamed feminism for the fact that they now needed to work outside the home.

Her campaign was crucial in preventing the ratification of the ERA, even though 30 of the necessary 38 states had ratified it within a year of its almost unanimous passage by Congress.

Signifies the fact that a political movement could share the same goal, but applied with different methodologies and political ideals.
