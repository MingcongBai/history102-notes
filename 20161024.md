Roosevelt on the Fiftieth Anniversay of The Statue of Liberty
-------------------------------------------------------------

*"Four hundred years ago, in Europe as well as in Asia, there was little hope of liberty for the average men of courage and goodwill. The ambitions of a ruling class and the times alike consipred against liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the person, liberty of economic opportuniy... They adopted this homeland because in this land they found a fhome in which the things they most desired could be theirs - freedom of opportunity, fredom of thought, freedom to worship God. Here they found life because here there was freedom to live."*

â€” Franklin D. Roosevelt

Section 7A
----------

Provision in the National Recovery Administration law (1933) which gave workers the right to join a union over their choosing. There were no substantial enforcement mechanisms but it inspired unskilled workers to organize/join a union.

Congress of Industrial Organizations
------------------------------------

Founded in 1935 as a more inclusive alternative to Americna Federation of Labor, with the help of John Lewis and the United Mine Workers.

Note, no gender (integrated) or racial (but members separated to prevent them from being "united") discrimination were not implied in this organization - but members are separated by skill level, not craft.

*"While Reuther set out a number of conditions for merger with the AFL, such as constitutional provisions supporting industrial unionism, guarantees against racial discrimination, and internal procedures to clean up corrupt unions, his weak bargaining position forced him to compromise most of these demands. Although the unions that made up the CIO survived, and in some cases thrived, as members of the newly created AFL-CIO, the CIO as an organization was folded into the AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Department."*

Communists and socialists played significant roles in this organization (mostly immigrants) - some changed their surnames to more "Anglo Saxxon" fashion, to "look over the past".

*"Communism is 20th Century Americanism!"*

Flint Town Strike
-----------------

United Auto Workers went on took over Flint Michigan factory on December 30th, 1936. Shut down General Motors as a result - earned tacit support of Roosevelt.

Victory sparked mass unionization.

Government in this case, did not crack down with violence - like they did back in the 19th Century.

*"It was important for the strikers to maintain order in the plant for Governor would intervene with the National Guard should property damage occur. In addition to maintaining order the civic government also insured a steady stream of supplies from friendly vendors outside the plant. Most of the meals for the approximately 2,000 were provided to the workers free of charge by a diner across the street."*

Wagner Act
----------

Also referred to as the National Labor Relations Act, replaced Section 7A of NRA, which established right to unionize.

- Established federal regulations of labor, permitting workers to unionize if a majority of workers voted in favor of the union.
- Banned employer intimidation of unions.
- Helped facilitate mass unionization, won the support of the workers.

*Four Freedoms*
---------------

In his 1941 State of the Union Address, Roosevelt declared America committed to four freedoms:

- Freedom from Want
- Freedom from Fear
- Freedom of Worship
- Freedom of Speech

Reasoned with immigrant working class and the CIO which had come to desire economic security.

CIO - Political Action Committee
--------------------------------

Pioneered by Jewish America labor organizer, Sydney Hillman in 1943 with an effort to mobilize union voters for the New Deal.

- First Political Action Committee in U.S. History.
- Reflects the cemented alliance between the New Deal and American labor.
