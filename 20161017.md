Fundamentalism and the Culture Wars of the 20s

*The Fundamentals*
------------------

A series of essays published by A. C. Dixon. Argued that the Bible was **free of errors** and was not a metaphor, but was rather **literal fact**. These essays were provided at free of charge to churches.

The morale of the series is that Christianity was never changed over time, and the Bible was, is, and will be the guide to daily lives and moralities.

"World Christian Fundamentals Association" was founded in America in 1919, to promote the ideas contained within the series.

This sparks the war between the modernist and fundamentalist christians throughout the era.

Butler Act
----------

The Act (only in effect in Tennessee, but later in other states, under different names) which prohibited teachings of the theory of evolution - which evidently contradicts Christianity ideals and teachings.

William Jennings Bryan, on the side of the State of Tennessee, wasn't a fundamentalist, but opposed the teaching of evolution.

### Darrow's Interrogation of Bryan

- Q: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first women was Eve?
- A: Yes.
- Q: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib?
- A: I do.

...

- Q: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife.
- A: That is what the Bible says.

Darrow in an attempt to generalize the fact that William Jennings Bryan was a fundamentalist, aiding the case against him. John Scopes did end up convicted for an obvious violation of the law - William Jennings Bryan died 5 days after the trial:

- Some says due to the pressure during the trial.
- Some believe due to the public humiliation (as shown above in the interrogation).

H. L. Mencken of the *Baltimore Sun*
------------------------------------

H. L. Menken, believer of the "Survival of the Fittest".

*"Its people are simply unable to imagine a man who rejects the literal authority of the Bible. The most they can conjure up, straining until they are red in the face, is a man who is error about the meaning of this or that text. Thus one accused of heresy among them is like one accused of boiling his grandmother to make soap in Maryland."*

On the very next day...

*"It would be hard to imagine a more moral town that Dayton. If it has any bootleggers, no visitors has heard of them... No fancy woman has been seen in the town since the end of the McKinley's administration. There is no gambling,. There is no place to dance... go to Robin's drug store and debate theology."*

In a depiction of the enclosed system of the South, under religion, and unable to iamgine those who did not share faith in certain religions.

*The Man Nobody Knows*
----------------------

Written by Bruce Barton in 1925: called Jesus the "founder of modern business", a model for modern advertising.

- Best seller for two years.
- Popularized idea that business and religion went hand in hand.

Did bring significant controversies in terms of this depiction of Jesus' doing and sacrefices.

*I'll Take My Stand*
--------------------

John Crowe Ransom helped assemble collection of essays arguing for the preservation of a traditional southern "agrarian" lifestyle.

*"How fair shall the South surrender its moral, social,a nd economic autonomy to the victorious principle of Union? That question remains open. The South is a minority section that has hitherto been jealous ..."*

And more interestingly...

*"We therefore look upon the Communist menace as a menace indeed, but not as a Red one; because it is simply according to the blind drift of our industrial development to expect in America at last much the same economic system as that imposed by violence upon Russia in 1917."*

Alfred E. Smith
---------------

Democratic Presidential nominee in 1928. Smith was of Irish and Italian descent, **first Catholic candidate for President of the United States**. Uneducated, never finished high school - worked in troupes, and showed high public speech skills.

Had helped make Tammany Hall more progressive, fighting for labor regulations as Governor of New York - and more interestingly, fought against Prohibition (recall).

Alfred E. Smith lost the election in a land slide against Hoover - even in some traditionally democratic and Southern states.
