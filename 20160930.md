William James
-------------

Professor at the Harvard University. Delivered *"The Will to Believe"* in 1896, and *"The Moral Equivalent of War"*  in 1906.

*"The martial type of character can be bred without war. Strenuous honor and disinterestedness abound everywhere. Priests and medical men are a fashion educated to it, and we should all feel some degree if its impreative if we were conscious of our work as an obligatory service to the state. We should be owned, as soldiers are owned by the army, and our pride would rise accordingly"*

— William James, *"The Moral Equivalent of War"*.

Roosevelt believed that the idea of a commercial-driven society, in particular, middle class lifestyle is endangering to the value of men of the nation (*Neurasthenia*).

He believed that people should have such an idea of being owned, morally owned by some greater value - like in the war, and should all live as if they were in the war - keep alert, and keep honor at the highest place.

Roosevelt to Steffens
---------------------

*"Curious enough, events have forced me to make my chief fights in public life against priviledge, but I know from actual experience - from experience of the most intimate kind in the little village of Oyster Bay and out in the West and Mendora, when there was not a special priviledge of any kind in either place - that what is needed is the fundamental fight for morality"*

— Theodore *"Teddy"* Roosevelt

We can see form the quote above that Roosevelt really wasn't against the idea of monopolies, but much rather the lack of morality in monopolies (punishments imposed).

Anthracite Coal Strike
----------------------

Roosevelt tried to mediate strike between United Mine Workers and mining corporations. When corporations refused to negotiate, Roosevelt threatened to nationalize them.

- First time a President intervened on behalf a labor union (though not explicitly); secured wage increase and reduction in hours, but did not force companies to recognize the Union.

Note: compare and contrast with the [Pullman Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Strike).

Theodore punishes monopolies and corporations that he felt has violated the public value - with Anti-Trust Laws - but not depending on the size and monopolistic factors of them.

Hepburn Act
-----------

Expanded power of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), gave power for ICC to operate independent of the courts, to investigate and determine fair rates, and required railroads to share their books with the ICC.

- Written in part by associates of J.P. Morgan.
- Stopped distribution of free railway passes to politicians (recall).

A display of Roosevelt's middle ground policies.

Hay-Herrán Treaty
-----------------

Roosevelt Corollary
-------------------

*"Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power."*

— Theodore Roosevelt
