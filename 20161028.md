Isolationism and the America First Committee
--------------------------------------------

- Nye Committee (1934)
- Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928)
- America First Committee (1940)
- William Pelley
- Lend and Lease (1941)
- Pearl Harbor (1941)

Pact of Steel
-------------

Italian alliance between Hitler and Germany, led by Mussolini's fascist state. Promised to defend each other under any circumstances. Japan, ended up joining the pact, forming an "Axis" alliance in 1940.

Especially in the case of Germany, which was effectively disarmed in the Treaty of Versailles, began their eastward invasion to Austria and Czechoslovakia - while in the case of Austria, it was annexed without violence for them also being a German-speaking country - forming the so-called "Greater Germany".

Gerald Nye
----------

North Dakota Senator, argued that America had entered World War I to protect profits of American arm makers. Inspired the passage of a series of neutrality acts that **banned trade with belligerent nations**.

*"The committee finds, under the head of the effect of armament, on peace, that some of the munitions companies have occasionally had opportunitites to intensify the fears of people for their neightbors and have used them to their own profit."*

Kellogg-Briand Pact
-------------------

Secretary of State Frank Kellogg avoided efforts to form an alliance with France, by offering a generalized promise to refrain from war except for cases of national *"defense"*.

65 nations signed the pact, however, no machanisms were put in place to enforce the pact.

America First Committee
-----------------------

Organized to prevent American support for Allies at the beginning of World War II. Found its strongest support in **Midwest**, Republican Progressives especially.

Came to be associated with anti-semitic ideas of Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh.

*"The America First Committee (AFC) was the foremost non-interventionist pressure group against the American entry into World War II. Peaking at 800,000 paid members in 450 chapters, it was one of the largest anti-war organizations in American history. Started on September 4, 1940, it was dissolved on December 10, 1941, three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the war to America."*


- The United States must build an impregnable defense for America.
- No foreign power, nor group of powers, can successfully attack a prepared America.
- American democracy can be preserved only by keeping out of the European war.
- "Aid short of war" weakens national defense at home and threatens to involve America in war abroad.

### William Dudley Pelley

In 1928, published an article about an out of body experience he claimed to have had. Founded paramilitary silver shirts in 1934, after Hitler came to power.

Planned to take over San Diego in 1935.

Cash and Carry
--------------

Revision of the neutrality acts, designed to allow the U.S. to send supplies to England - passed in September of 1939.

Allowed trade in non-military supplies:

- All trade must be conducted with cash.
- American goods must be shipped on foreign vessels.

Lend Lease
----------

Expanded upon the exemption in neutrality acts created by Cash and Carry.

Allowed U.S. government to "lend" military supplies to England and other allies, in treturn for use of military bases and access to technologies.

Because Americans were concerned that war profiteering would lead the U.S. in war, lend lease essentially gave weapon away for free.

Pearl Harbor
------------

December 7th, 1941, Japanese forces carries out a surprise attack against the U.S. Military base in Hawaii.

Served as the basis for declaration of war against Japen, and by extension Germany and Italy, by the following day. Stifled isolationist sentiment, creating a consensus around American's involvement in the World War II.
