Fore-Notes (Lyndon B. Johnson)
------------------------------

Lyndon Johnson's biggest mistake during his term might have been the decision to escalate the Vietnam War - which was initially started by John F. Kennedy. He would have been otherwise credited widely by young and liberal populus crowd, but this decision has driven him to a troubling term:

- Not enough fund to support his liberal programs, as a result of war spending.
- Perceived as an enemy against liberals (for suppression of anti-war protests, etc.).

Civil Rights Act of 1964
------------------------

Banned discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. Applied to all public accommodations including businesses, **ending segregation**.

- Proposed by Kennedy in response to violence in Alabama (recall, the "Bull").
- Pushed through by LBJ arguing that it was necessary to fulfill Kennedy's legacy.
- Precipated the South's departure from the Democratic Party.

Barry Goldwater
---------------

Conservative Senator from Arizona.

Believed in Civil Rights in principle, opposed the Civil Rights of 1964. Argued for a major pushback in New Deal programs - represents the rise of conservatism to national prominence and the changing political allegiance of the South.

Economic Opportunity Act
------------------------

Allocated 800 million USD to the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Funded an array of programs like Job Corps, Corps, VISTA, Head Start, preschool programs, food stamps. Created Community Action Programs that funded local groups fighting poverty.

Centerpiece of LBJ's war on poverty.

Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
-------------------------

Precipitated by the fear that North Korean Communist Troops had fired torpedoes at the U.S. Destroyer *Maddox*.

On August 7th, 1964, Congress passed according to LBJ's request, a resolution allowing him to take *"all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the forces of United States and to prevent further aggression."*

Did not formally declare war, but gave Johnson authority to escalate war, util half a million American soldiers were stationed in Vietnam.
