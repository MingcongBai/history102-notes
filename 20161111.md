John F. Kennedy
---------------

Elected in 1960 as President, defeating Richard Nixon.

Youngest President to be elected, at the age of 43 (Theodore Roosevelt became President at age of 42, but not elected).

First Catholic President (after the defeat of "Al" Smith, recall, who was also a Catholic). He gain part of his advantage with the first live TV presidential debate - where he looked more attrative and confident, in comparison to Nixon, who refused to wear make-ups and was constantly sweating.

*"Those who watched the debate said Kennedy would win, those who listened tended to say otherwise."*

Sputnik
-------

Russia launched Sputnik, an unmanned satellite into space in 1957. The first case of space exploration.

Kennedy used Sputnik (along with alleged missile gap) to argue that Republicans had allowed the United States to fall behind in the cold war. Kennedy would campaign on sending a man to the Moon.

Represents Kennedy's emphasis on the Cold War in his campaign for the Presidency in 1960.

Bay of Pigs
-----------

Kennedy assisted Cuban rebels who staged a failed invasion attempting to overthrow Fidel Castro's Communist regime.

- Despite his failure, 76% of Americans approved of Kennedy after the invasion.

- Led to Castro's effort to arm himself with nuclear weapons and thus the Cuban Missle Crisis.

*Protestant-Catholic-Jew*
-------------------------

Written by Will Herberg in 1955.

Emphasized the idea that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews had a shared set of values, that contrasted with "atheistic communism". This represented the Cold War push to ease differences between religious sectsm that can be perceived in Kennedy's Presidency.

*Silent Spring*
---------------

Written by Rachel Carson and published in 1962.

Demonstrated that pesticides poisoned animals through the natural ecosystem. Served as the **foundation for modern environmentalism**.

Shifted focus from conservation, focused on saving particular pieces of land, to stopping the use of toxins that influenced the whole ecosystem.

Betty Friedan
-------------

*"The problem that has no name - which is simply the fact that American women are kept from growing to their full human capacities - is taking a far greater toll on the physical and mental health of our country than any known disease."*

*"Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover..."*

Young Americans for Freedom
---------------------------

Established in 1960, with the assistance of William Buckley, editor of *National Review* - a conservative political-centric megazine.

Distributed the paper *"New Guard"* on campuses, winning recruits that would serve as the foundation for the foundation for the conservative movement in later years.
