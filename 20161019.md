The Great Depression
--------------------

Caused by the over-inflation of the Stock Market:

- Large portion of the population bought stock shares;
- Large portion of the population bought stock shares with their loans, but not actual owned capitals;

Another contribution factor is the international loans never being payed back, over stretching the United States credits.

The market collapsed in 1929, leading to the Great Depression of 1929 - stock values dropped by at least 50% on the Black Tuesday. Businesses loaned money and sold off stock shares, leading to further drop in capitals - and as banks were scared of loosing all assets, stopped issuing loans, hurting the economy even further.
