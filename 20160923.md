Today's topic: Progressivism
----------------------------

The shift in the popular opinion that demanded the government to increase intervention on the economical system, as opposed the old idea of excluding the government in day-to-day affairs.

The Panic and all those unstability during the Guilded Age has made people belive in the positive effect of government work.

Gold was discovered in the West after The Panic, the United States has reached an unprecedented prosperity.

Lincoln Steffens
----------------

Wrote *"Tweed Days in St. Louis"* for McClure's Magazine in 1902.

The rise of magazine literature has made it possible for progressives to reach out to others, whether they be progressive or not.

*"Your majesty seems to wish to rule, you alone. Your peope are demanding representation in your government. Apparently you both regard your purposes as cross and incompatible. They are not so. Read my book and you will see that we Americans have what we call 'Representative democracy;' but we have Czars, too."*

*"The thing we call capital... has become a part of our government."*

Steffens believe that democracy is non-existence if capital is controlled by few in the society (monopoly), relating to his own concern to capital with the government, and the lack of democracy and corruption as the results.

Meat Inspection Act of 1906
---------------------------

American meat was banned shortly before this Act, as the meat packing industry lacked in inspection, sanitation, and disease control.

- Inspired by Upton Sinclair depiction of meat packing industry in *The Jungle*.
- Passed alongside the Pure Food and Drug Act, which created the Food and Drug Administration.
- Built upon regulatory apparatus of the Bureau of Animal Industry, which under industry urging began to regulate exported meat in 1891.

*"The original 1906 Act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to inspect and condemn any meat product found unfit for human consumption. Unlike previous laws ordering meat inspections, which were enforced to assure European nations from banning pork trade, this law was strongly motivated to protect the American diet. All labels on any type of food had to be accurate (although not all ingredients were provided on the label). Even though all harmful food was banned, a few warnings were still provided on the container. The law was partly a response to the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, an exposé of the Chicago meat packing industry, as well as to other Progressive Era muckraking publications of the day."*

Walter Rauschenbusch
--------------------

Pastor of the Second German Baptist Church in New York. *Christianity and Social Crisis* published in 1907 argued that immorality was the result of poverty and social injustice, promoted "postmillennialism".

*"The Gospel, to have full power over an age, must be the highest expression of the moral and religious truth of that age. If it lags behind and deals in outgrown concepts of life and duty, it will lose power over the ablest minds and the yound men first, and gradually over all. In our thought today the social problems inrresistibly take the lead. If the Church has no live and bold thought on the dominant question of modern life, its teaching authority on all other questions will dwindle and be despised."*
