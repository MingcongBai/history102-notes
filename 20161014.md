Warren G. Harding
-----------------

*"America's present need is not heroic, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; ... The world needs to be reminded that all human ills are not curable by legislation, and that quantity of statutory enactment and excess of government offer no substitute for quality of citizenship."*

Warren Harding argues against government intervention in economic matters, but should be more focused on citizen morals and racial distribution.

Progressivism was largely exhausted during the World War I, which many finds to be "too complex" for their daily lives - wanting a return to the simpler lives. In addition, the Russian Revolution, brought fear of totalitarian government influences.
