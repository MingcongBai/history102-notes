Immigration wave of 1871 - 1910
-------------------------------

The second wave of immigrants showed very different properties as compared to historical waves:

- More population came from the central, eastern, and southern Europe.
- Most settled in cities.
- Majority of lower middle classmen who immigrated in pursuit of higher wages.

Chinese immigrants, however:

- Mostly came as contract labors.
- Some escaped contracts due to poor deals.
- Gold rush, and Trans-atlantic Railroad. And later moved to laundry work (as a trade).

Padrones
--------

Italian term for **labor agents**, often used to refer generally to labor agents from all ethnicities during second wave immigration.

- In return for a fee advised immigrants about where to settle and helped connect them to employers in relevant industries when they arrived.
- Along with family connections, helped to ensured that immigrants relocated as part of an ethnic community, grouping in similar neighbourhoods and occupations.

The Melting Pot
---------------

Written by Israel Zangwill.

- Protagonist: David Quixano, a Russian Jew who marries a Christian after moving to America. Pursuing the abolishment of ethnicity ("A Republic of Men").

Workingmen's Party
------------------

Formed after San Francisco Riot of 1877, under Leadership of Denis Kearney fought to restrict Chinese Immigration. Helped make Chinese immgration a national issue, culminating in Chinese Exclusion Act of 1884.

- Cause: most Chinese immigrants may work with lower wage, making a large influx of Chinese in Chinese employment in areas.

*"Our moneyed men have ruled us for the past thirty years. Under the flag of the slaveholder they hoped to destroy our liberty. Failing in that, they have rallied under the banner of the millionaire, the banker and land monopolist, the railroad king and the false politician, to effect their purpose... To add to our misery and despair, a bloated aristocracy has sent to China - the greatest and oldest despotism in the world - for a cheap working slave. It rakes the slums of Asia to find the meanest slave on Earth - the Chinese coolie - and imports him here to meet the free American in the labor market, and still further widen the breach between the rich and the poor, still further to degrade white labor"*
