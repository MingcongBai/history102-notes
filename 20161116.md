Redlining
---------

Refers to the redlines drawn around certain neighbourhoods which were deemed too financially risky to offer loans to. From 1933 to 1968, the Federal Housing Administration explicitly refused to back mortgages in neighbourhoods with minorities.

Made it difficult for African Americans to purchase homes - encouraged residential segregation.

Metropolitan Association for Segregated Education
-------------------------------------------------

Also known as M.A.S.E.

Atlanta integrated public schools in 1961, without violence.

Organizations liek MASE, however, opposed integrated schools, arguing that it disproportionately impacted poor whites and that it violated individual's freedom to associate with who they choose.

Represents a shift in segregationist rhetoric toward moderate sounding arguments, of those appealing to individual freedom.

Led by real estate agent, Thomas Wesley Jr.
