Wilson and Progressivism on the Global Stage (WWI)
--------------------------------------------------

- Veracruz (1914)
- Lusitania (1915)
- Zimmerman Note (1917)
- War Industries Board (1917)
- Revenue Act of 1916
- Committee on Public Information (1917 - 1919)
- Espionage Act (1917)
- Treaty of Versailles (1919)

The Establishment of International Interventionism
--------------------------------------------------

Recall from the Taft's presidency (Dollar Diplomacy), and Roosevelt's intervention in affairs of Latin American countries - and not to mention the annexation of Philippines.

Both being progressive characters, they believed in the intervention could be beneficial for the nations - in terms of democratic government and free trade.

Mexico Presidents and Politics
------------------------------

Francisco Madero, a progressive Mexican politician, unfavoured by the American corporations. They called for the murder attempt on President Madero - which succeeded with his death in 1913.

### Occupation of Veracruz (1914)

Inspired by the detention of American soldiers in Tampico. Began with naval blockade meant to target the dictactor Huerta, who had beensupported by President Taft (however reversed in the term of Woodrow Wilson).

This helped to secure the Presidency for the reformer Madero, but was widely attacked by all political factions in Mexico.

Although the former attempts by the United States to annex Mexican land was never appreciated by the Mexicans themselve - especially not in this case which American troops occupied their city - however this action did end up helping the democratic reform to take place in Mexico.

Assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand
------------------------------------

European countries by the early 20th century maintained an alliance system, which was proven to be problematic - in the race for colonies, and in multiple incidents - especially in the case of the assassination of the Arch Duke Ferdinand, which resulted in the start of the World War I.

(Recall: machine guns, mustard gas, and Trench Warfare)

### American's Point

Woodrow Wilson, as well as most of the American's population by the time opposed the intervention in wars - as in accordance to Washington's Farewell Address.

In the case of Belgium Occupation, the sea and land traffic to this nation occupied by Germany was cut off completely - being one of the most urbanized countries in Europe, this seemed inhumane. United States, in consideration of this, argued that this is a violation to free trade on the sea.

United States also funded England and France durign the war, resulted in the transformation of the United States from a large debter nation to a major creditor nation.

### The U-Boat

The U-Boats (or submarines) of Germany was used to sink ships on the sea - brought the United States closer to the war.

The sinking of the Lusitania of America **did not** result in Wilson to declare war on Germany immidiately. Instead, he did negotiate with Germany (and a treaty was formed) for them to not sink supply ships, but only those of alliance army.

- [Wikipedia: U-Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat)

### Theodore Roosevelt on Wilson

*"I suppose... in a democracy like ours the people will always do well or ill largely in proportion to their leadership. If Lincoln had acted after the firing of Sumter in the way that Wilson did about the sinking of the Lusitania, in one month th eNorth would have been saying they were so glad he kept them out of the war and that they were too proud to fight and that at all costs hazardous fratricidal war must be averted."*

Zimmerman Note
--------------

After Germany decided to begin attacks on American ships travelling to Allies, cutting off their supplies, Germany conspired to try to enlist Mexico's support in war with America. Arthur Zimmerman offered Mexico financial support and the return of territory taken by the United States, including Texas and California, in return for attacking the United States.

Woodrow Wilson ordered all merchandice vessles to be armed in defense of U-Boats.

Woodrow Wilson, after 5 U.S. vessles sank by the U-Boats, called the congress for declaring of war against Germany. Woodrow Wilson reasoned his call for war was simply described as:

- There should be balance of power between nations, large or small.
- Large nations/major powers should form alliance, in prevention of the "bullying" of smaller nations.
- Spreading democracy, Germany's war was a result of non-democratic government system.

Selective Service Act
---------------------

Foundation to the growing size of the U.S. arm force. The bureaucratics still exist to this day, however, democratic was regarded more significantly back when it first established than it is now.

Nationalization during WWI
--------------------------

Railroads were nationalized in 1917 as a wartime measure to ensure that railroad are run efficiently - as private companies were unwilling to provide support given their loss in running transports during the war.

The Russian Revolution
----------------------

In November of 1917, the Bolsheviks succeeded in the Russian Revolution, forming the first Communist Nation in the world.

Due to popular fear that nationalization and other radical wartime measures, the government did revert most of the measures taken during wartime.

War Effort and Propaganda
-------------------------

The Committee of Public Information, formed in 1917, was set responsibility to create propaganda leaflets and movies.

The Espionage Act
-----------------

A piece of legislature introduced during the war with extensive political implication on progressive individuals, media, and groups in regard with:

- Their criticism of the Federal Government, the Army, and the War.
- Their attempt in spreading "unpatriotic" speeches and ideas.
- Their tendency of alignment with Communism and revolution under such terms.
