The process of the Reconstruction
---------------------------------

The process of Reconstruction began even before the end of the Civil War. Generals of the Civil War believed that troops have the responsibility to aid freedmen on reconstruction and public service, or getting aid.

Generals understand that something needs to be done for the contraband camp.

Some believed that freedmen were not really "free" until they would get their own land and to help themselves to get started with life.

Some freedmen believed that having a land is not the true meaning of freedom if they were going to be bounded with their own land, which seems similar to working for a plantation - except without their masters.

Instability in agricultral economics emerged with the choice in plantation, for example, freedmen preferred not to grow cotton - which for one was not as valuable as it was before the Civil War, and for two, cotton was often referred to slavery.

Some freedmen chose to travel (as they did not have the right to do so before), most went either with army camps or migrated to the cities.

One of the most contentious issue from the Southern states was when and how will the Southern states be able to reenter the Union: when more than 10% of the state citizens pledge their allegance with the Union.

Andrew Johnson
--------------

Southerner by birth. Only senator from the South to vote in flavor for the Union. Mis-understood by many radicals from the Union as the guardian for the old Southern system (confederacy).

Supported the Emancipation Proclamation. However, believed that the masters still holds rights over their freedmen, therefore went against voting rights of the freedmen.

*"Johnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction – a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions."*

The Freedmen's Bureau
---------------------

Established in 1865, the Freedmen's Bureau's duty was to help freedmen and their families with employment and food of their members.

The bureau also helped freedmen with education and legal issues.

The bureau's existence was weakened with the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) movement.

The 14th Amendament
-------------------

*"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."*

— Section 1, *14th Amendment*

Effects of the Reconstruction
-----------------------------

Strengthens the government's effect with the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Expanded effectively the requirements for Southern States to re-enter the Union:

- The Blacks must be allowed to vote.
- The Blacks must be allowed to serve in the government.

The Southern States used to have almost half the tax rates of that in the Northern States for a lack of public services and schools. With freedmen in power (with significant victory of the Republican Party through out the States), governments, especially those in the Southern States established public services: education, transportation, land, and medication.

Black elected governors started to emerge with the Reconstruction.

Black elected governors and government workers in the idea of the traditional Southern States, violated the rules of the whites (or white supremacy).

Freedmen organized civil protesting, and press. Freemen tends to be more radical, and more actively participated in political. July the 4th had once became the celebration of all freedmen.

Radical phase of the Reconstruction however, was short-lived.

The Ku Klux Klan (KKK)
----------------------

The KKK suppresses votes for the Republicans through means of violence, furthermore, attempted assassination and harrassment of government officials of the Republicans.

The KKK meant to recover the Black Code of the South.

#### The 15th Amendament

*"Section 1.*

*The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.*

*Section 2.*

*The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."*

— *The 15th Amendament*

This amendament resulted in martial laws to be put in effect to suppress, arrest, or even terminate KKK activities by force.
