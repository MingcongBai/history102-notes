Western Expansion, the Yeoman Farmer and the Conquest of Native America.

Key Points
----------

- Homestead Act (1862)
- Bozeman Trail
- Sand Creek Massacre (1864)
- Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)
- Dawes Severality Act (1887)
- Wounded Knee Massacre (1890)
- Joseph Glidden (1873)

The Louisiana Purchase
----------------------

Purchased in 1803 from Napoleon by Thomas Jeffereson, in the belief that this will extend the life of the Republic.

Early 19th century, the Louisana territory was called the Indian Country under effect of the Indian Intercourse Act, with definition taken as follows:

*"The Nonintercourse Act (also known as the Indian Intercourse Act or the Indian Nonintercourse Act) is the collective name given to six statutes passed by the Congress in 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, 1802, and 1834 to set Amerindian boundaries of reservations. The various Acts also regulate commerce between Americans and Native Americans. The most notable provisions of the Act regulate the inalienability of aboriginal title in the United States, a continuing source of litigation for almost 200 years. The prohibition on purchases of Indian lands without the approval of the federal government has its origins in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783."*

— Wikipedia, *"Nonintercourse Act"*

The Indian reservations used to be one large territory, but later carved into smaller portions for each of the specific tribes. However, there exists differences in lifestyles of different tribes, as western tribes used to live via hunting and gathering, while ones in mid-west used to live via agriculture (bison became the epicenter of the lifestyle of the mid-western tribes).

Conflicts between the whites and Indians
----------------------------------------

Mid-western could not odd with their territory as they could not support their own lifestyle to within the carved reservations. They wander out for game, as white settlers wander into their reservations for resource - bringing conflicts and violent militia wars.

White militia attacked Indians in the Colorado area with no regard for women and children - which were massacred in the same fashion as fighting men. The Federal Government did condemn this action, however, did not take legislative actions against the militias at the time.

Bozeman Trail - Treaty of Fort Laramie
--------------------------------------

Post-war
--------

The Indians did manage to hold on to their territory, however the Federal Government was no longer hoping to negotiate with the American Indain tribes, and began to disregard their independent status as nations.

Attempts to assimilate tribe members with Americans under the [Dawes Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act).

*"The Dawes Act of 1887 (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887), adopted by Congress in 1887, authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians. Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship."*

— Wikipedia, *"Dawes Act"*

The Act was largely a failure, and was reverted in the 1930's by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Schools and Assimilation
------------------------

Schools established for Indians were largely boarding schools which has severe penalty for any action taken against the assimilation progress:

- Any ritual performed by Indian students.
- Speaking of Indian native languages in any situation.

...

Fierce violent resistance carries out by the Indian for this disregard of their culture.

The Wounded Knee Massacre
-------------------------

- Read [here](http://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/wounded-knee).
- Read this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre).

Significant Indian deaths due to unequal weapon forces owned by the opposite sides (as Americans already have machine guns by the time).

Westward Expansion
------------------

- Of the Chinese immigrants (for gold rush and the the Central Pacific Railroad).
- Of cowboys (very diverse, at least 25% each for Hispanics and Blacks).
- Of whites that immigrates westward for opportunities.

- See [Hamlin Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlin_Garland).
- See [A Son of the Middle Border](https://books.google.com/books?id=-UNQfRvYXZUC&pg=PT281&lpg=PT281&dq=if+your+crop+fails+try+a+new+soil&source=bl&ots=r8ruMVz05U&sig=47S8MymN-sJFnCYa3i9o7n6vU08&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjShL_bo4_PAhUf3YMKHep7DhUQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=if%20your%20crop%20fails%20try%20a%20new%20soil&f=false).

Also research: laws and private governments of the cowboys.

Fencing and barbwires, and the protection of private properties in the West - against wandering cowboys. As businesses and individuals started their enterprise with a large plot of land in the West.

The Homestead Act of Oklahoma
-----------------------------

See [Land Rush of 1899](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rush_of_1889).

*"The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the first land rush into the Unassigned Lands. The area that was opened to settlement included all or part of the present-day Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of the US state of Oklahoma. The land run started at high noon on April 22, 1889, with an estimated 50,000 people lined up for their piece of the available two million acres (8,000 km²)."*

— Wikipedia, *"Land Rush of 1899"*

#### Fun facts on Boomers and Sooners...

*"A number of the people who participated in the run entered the unoccupied land early and hid there until the legal time of entry to lay quick claim to some of the most choice homesteads. These people came to be identified as 'Sooners.' This led to hundreds of legal contests that arose and were decided first at local land offices and eventually by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Arguments included what constituted the 'legal time of entry.' While some people think that the settlers who entered the territory at the legally appointed time were known as "boomers," the term actually refers to those who campaigned for the opening of the lands, led by David L. Payne."

Remarks
-------

The Western part of the United States, more than any part of the Nation, relies on the aid of the Federal Government (the protection of settlers against the Indians, sponsored railroads, homestead acts...). However, a different story to all natives that had been living in this region.

The disappearance of the Frontier Line
--------------------------------------

*"In 1890 the superintendent of the U.S. Census announced that rapid western settlement meant that 'there can hardly be said to be a frontier line.' In just a quarter century, the far western frontier had been settled. Three million families started farms on the Great Plains during these years."*

Although led by individuals, most did undermine the fact that the Federal Government was immersed in the process to reach this milestone in the territorial history of the United States.
