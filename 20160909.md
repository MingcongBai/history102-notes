Basis of Abolishment
--------------------

The [proclaimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation) of Abraham Lincoln, the beginning of abolishment of slavery. [The Crittenden–Johnson Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crittenden%E2%80%93Johnson_Resolution) passed in congress with little opposition votes.

The Civil War was fought by the North with the only expectation of slavery abolishment.

Abolitionists had a long influence in the North. The American Abolishment Association:

- Native borns.
- Evangelists.
- Often disrupted with violence.

Literacy had a strong effect in pushing abolishment foward, especially those by African Americans to counter against stereotyped African American treatment:

- African Americans were unable in literacy.
- "Godly" enslaved.
- Racially stereotyped.

In 1836, Congress passed the [Gag rule](http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-House-of-Representatives-instituted-the-%E2%80%9Cgag-rule%E2%80%9D/) that banned discussion of slavery in the Congress.

The Invasion and the Compromise
-------------------------------

[Compromise of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1850), with prior invasion of Mexico after which forms most of the Western United States. Slavery were uncertain in such areas, where supporters of slavery and those who went against it fought violently against each other.

**Note: Unorganized Territory where the Federation was unable to ban slavery in such territory.**

Free Soil Party
---------------

[Free Soil Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Soil_Party) did apply their ideal on free territory. However, never did show opposition to slavery, nor did it claim that slavery was fundamentally unjust. **Note: Often times working class whites.**

*"But another class of reasoners hold the opinion that there is no such relation between capital and labor, as assumed; and that there is no such thing as a freeman being fatally fixed for life, in the condition of a hired laborer, that both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them groundless. They hold that labor is prior to, and independent of, capital; that, in fact, capital is the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed -- that labor can exist without capital, but that capital could never have existed without labor. Hence they hold that labor is the superior -- greatly the superior -- of capital."*

— Abraham Lincoln

The Fugitive Slave Act
----------------------

[Fugitive Slave Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850) allowed individual right to determine whether one is a slave or not. Significant opposition especially in Wisconsin, violent opposition took place in the following months and years where incredible amount of man power was put down to save/liberate, or to go otherwise for a fugitive slave.

Increasing violence of the pro-slavery, in which slavery made great pride for the slave owners - in comparison to feudalism system of Europe before the period (as they see themselves as lords).

Accuses the North of free labor - in comparison to [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) - with no guarantee of health service and free love (which did not happen before the 19th century).

At Brink of War
---------------

Lincoln was hesistant on a Civil War, however, did not tolerant any seccession (for example, the one happened in [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_in_the_American_Civil_War#Secession)). In which case he did attempt to draw Federal troops away from the South.

"War of the Northern Agression" wasn't a true naming as the Union did shot the first fire of the war.

Abraham Lincoln did show a certain degree of undermining of the Blacks, however, did suggest or hypothesized abolishment.

["The Nation"](https://books.google.com/books?id=NipCIZvD2zUC&pg=PA744&lpg=PA744&dq=the+nation+the+issue+of+the+war+mark+an+epoch+by+the+consolidation&source=bl&ots=teDYj_ArDR&sig=ll2_nJupWeInYTDJ-SbiyvpNDbc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUkrbO2oLPAhUD9h4KHbQyCYkQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=the%20nation%20the%20issue%20of%20the%20war%20mark%20an%20epoch%20by%20the%20consolidation&f=false). The idea of a consolidated states with collaborating states instead of individual independent states.

**Note: impact on nation-wide bussinesses.**

The Homestead Act of 1862
-------------------------

Land Grants, see [Land-grant Universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university).

See [Benjamin Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Butler_%28politician%29#Civil_War).

Contraband
----------

*"Contraband was a term commonly used in the United States military during the American Civil War to describe a new status for certain escaped slaves or those who affiliated with Union forces."*

Enlistement of Freemen
----------------------

Freedom of African Americans has encouraged them to enlist in the army and join the cause of the North.

There was fear that enlistment of former slaves for military purposes, which interestingly shows strong similarities to how the South enlists slaves for the war effort - which may just defeat the purpose of the Civil War for the abolishment effort.

After death of Abraham Lincoln
------------------------------

The South did attempt to revert the status of the Civil War (that is, to re-implement slavery in a way).

The 13th Amendment

*"Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.*

*Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."*
