The Black Freedom Movement
--------------------------

- Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954)

- SNCC (1960)
- Freedom Ride (1961)
- Nation of Islam
- Chicago Freedom Movement (1967)

*"Quite an ironic day to be talking about human rights, but nor did I intend so."*

Migration of African Americans to the North was a consequence of the two World Wars, in need for industrial production - where they earned substantially higher wages, and allowed for their right to vote - which was not yet allowed in the South.

Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
-----------------------

*"In 1961, after 16 years in the House, Powell became chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, the most powerful position held by an African American in Congress. As Chairman, he supported the passage of important social and civil rights legislation under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson."*

*"He also urged United States presidents to support emerging nations in Africa and Asia as they gained independence after colonialism."*

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka
-------------------------------------

Professional psychologists testified that segregation created feelings of inferiority, so that "separate but equal" in education was impossible.

Supreme Court ruled that segregation was unconstitutional, but didn't demand an immediate change - called for use of "all deliberate speed".

*"However, the decision's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II only ordered states to desegregate 'with all deliberate speed'."*

In the case of Arkansas, Eisenhower ordered National Guards to escort African American students with attending school - in a fear of United States' image abroad.
