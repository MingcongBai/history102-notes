Ronald Reagan and the Collapse of the New Deal Coalition
--------------------------------------------------------

- Proposition 13 (1978)
- Laffer Curve (1978)
- Economic Recovery Tax Act (1981)
- PATCO (1981)

People often find themselves comparing Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, not for their political ideals - in fact they were opposite in this regard - however, both were able to implement sustainable change to the United States' political and economical systems.

Ronald Reagan often represented the right, in compensation of the discontent of the 70s - he would build an identity for the Republican Party - conservatism, small government, and opposition to taxation. Reagan was a good speaker, often regarded as a great communicator.

In fact, Ronald Reagan regarded Franklin D. Roosevelt as his role model - Reagan's father worked for the Works Progress Administration - a government institution introduced by Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deals. However, Reagan argued that Lyndon B. Johnson's policies had left the United States in economical turmoil.

Ronald Reagan was a figure in the entertainment industry, as President of Screen Actors Guild - acting for Hollywood. After his downhill in acting, he worked in public speaking occasions. He also shifted party - leaving the Democratic Party - in the 60s after Kennedy was elected President.

*"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."*

Ronald Reagan was similar to Barry Goldwater, however, different in their tones in communication - unlike Barry Goldwater with favor for extremism and stern ideals - Ronald Reagan succeeded in his way with communication.

He was the first Union leader to be elected President.

Proposition 13
--------------

California referendum in 1978 pushed by the conservative businessman Howard Jarvis. Resulted in a cut on property taxes and prevented property tax valuation from rising with the rate of inflation.

Required that new tax cuts pass with 2/3rds majority by the state legislature in order to go into effect - helped inspiring a national tax revolt that would help shape Reagan's presidency.

Before the Proposition 13, California had 4 million dollars in excess. The effect of this proposition is quite clear at present day.

Laffer Curve
------------

In 1974, economist Arthur Laffer argued to a group of Republicans, including Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney - that tax cuts would actually increase government revenue. The idea was popularized in the wake of Proposition 13 when Jude Wanniski wrote an article on the subject for *Public Interest*.

Ronald Reagan used this idea to justify tax cuts, though George H. W. Bush called it "Voodoo Economics".

Economic Recovery Act of 1981
-----------------------------

Cut taxes across the board and indexed taxes to inflation - to prevent "bracket creep", which slowly pushed American's into higher tax rates.

Tax rates would never return to pre-Reagan level.

PATCO
-----

See the 1981 PATCO strike.

*"On August 3, 1981, during a press conference regarding the PATCO strike, President Reagan stated: 'They are in violation of the law and if they do not report for work within 48 hours they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.'"*

Also note that PATCO was the only labor union to endorse Ronald Reagan during his presidency.
