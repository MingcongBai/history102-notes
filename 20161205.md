The Moral Majority
------------------

- National Council of Churches
- Engel v. Vitale (1962)
- Jerry Falwell

The Moral Majority was found in 1979, putting pressure on the Republicans to push for religious foundamentalism. Attaching this fundamentalism to the Repulican Party, putting a new demographic of supporters - especially those of conservative ideals (the issue of abortion).

A shift from liberalism to more conservative basis - with an interest to "fight back" to the social changes and revolutions took place in the 60s. Social justice and economical changes were more associated with religion - especially for Protestants.

National Council of Churches
----------------------------

Founded in 1950 as an ecumenical (promoting or tending toward worldwide Christian unity or cooperation) organization, representing Orthodox and Mainline protestant churches. Its doctrines were generally liberal and postmillenialist, emphasizing economic reforms as a means to eliminate sin.

Related churches tended to stop growing or even to decline during the 1970s.

Engel v. Vitale
---------------

Stephen Engel, a practing Jew from New York, sued in response to a daily prayer in a public school. Court ruled 6-1 that the First Amendment barred public schools officials frominitiating prayer.

Part of series of ruling that followed after the court ruled in 1961 that the separation of church and state established in the First Amendment applied to states as well as the federal government. It was followed in 1963 with *Abington School District v. Schempp*, which banned the forced reading of the Bible in schools, then *Epperson v. Arkansas*, which in 1968 ended bans on teaching evolution.

helped reinforce push for private Christian schools, because public schools were too secular for many fundamentalists.

Founded the Lynchburg Christian Academy in 1967 and Liberty University in 1971 as a reaction to integration and secularization of public schools.

Falwell was brought into politics by Anita Bryant's "Save Our Children" campain, Roe v. Wade, Engel v. Vitale, and IRS regulations that would have ended the tax exempt of segregated Christian schools. In 1979, Falwell helped founding the Moral Majority Inc., which registered four million evangelical voters, and made ending abortion a major part of the Republican Party platform.
