The influence of being isolated
-------------------------------

The United States had long been an isolated nation on its own, in both senses of its unique political progression, and their geological location. (Since with Washington's farewell speech)

This sense of isolation lasted all the way to the 1940's, with strong opposition to foreign intervention.

The expansion and invasion
--------------------------

The invasion of Mexico in 1848, and the call for annexation of Cuba, the whole of the Mexican Gulf.

The Northerners was oppose of most of these actions or intentions, they see it as "an expansion of slavery" - through means of territorial invasion and expansion.

The road to Imperialism
-----------------------

There is tendency toward to Imperialism from Early to Late 19th Century, aided with Darwin's evolutionary theory, a sense of White superiority was formed that:

- Whites as an advanced race.
- The "responsibility" to conquer and put certain racial groups into "use" (in economical and production).

Colonialism was seen as a product of this Imperialist movement, some Americans found themselves "left behind" for not joining the colonial expansions around the world.

Alfred Thayer Mahan
-------------------

Published *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History* in 1890, argued taht sea power was necessary to preserve commerce in an industrial society.

In which case, such industrial society tends to produce excess in goods, therefore:

- There must be exports.
- Ships must be able to ship goods:
  - Priviledge on the oceans.
  - Navy to protect the shipments.

Inspired Secretary of Navy Benjamin Tracey to increase the size of the American Navy considerably (ranked 12th in the world before his term, and 7th after).

Expansion into Hawaii
---------------------

Import of Hawaiian Sugar with the lifted tariffs, however, this also led to American's influence upon Hawaii, first with Hawaiians allowing Americans to build naval bases on the islands.

The outcome was that Americans started building plantations on the islands of Hawaii.

*"Threatened by the queen's proposed new constitution, American and European businessmen and residents organized to depose Liliʻuokalani, asserting that the queen had "virtually abdicated" by refusing to support the 1887 Constitution. Business interests within the Kingdom were also upset about what they viewed as "poor governance" of the Kingdom, as well as the U.S. removal of foreign tariffs in the sugar trade due to the McKinley Tariff. The tariff eliminated the favored status of Hawaiian sugar guaranteed by the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. American and Europeans actively sought annexation by the United States so that their business might enjoy the same sugar bounties as domestic producers. In addition to these concerns, Lili'uokalani believed that American businessmen, like Charles R. Bishop, expressed an anxiety concerning a female head of state."*

— *[Wikipedia:: Queen Liliuokalani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliuokalani)*

*"On January 14, 1893, a group composed of Americans and Europeans formed a Committee of Safety seeking to overthrow the Hawaiian Kingdom, depose the Queen, and seek annexation by the United States. As the coup d'état was unfolding on January 17, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American citizens. In response, United States Government Minister John L. Stevens summoned a company of US Marines from the USS Boston and two companies of U.S. Navy sailors to take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall. On the afternoon of January 16, 1893, 162 sailors and U.S. Marines aboard the USS Boston in Honolulu Harbor came ashore under orders of neutrality. Historian William Russ has noted that the presence of these troops, ostensibly to enforce neutrality and prevent violence, effectively made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself."*

Independence of Cuba
--------------------

Cuban's attempt on independence from Spain was unsuccessful, resulting in brutal suppression by the Spainsh, and was concentrated into armed camps.

*"... to authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between the government of Spain and the people of Cuba, and to ensure in the island the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these purposes."*

The Maine exploded in 1898, congress claimed that the Spanish navy bombed the vessel (although recently found to be accidental), which built ground for later military involement.

Cuba was liberated with military aid from the United States (direct involvement).

The war against Spanish in an effort to liberate Cuba only lasted 2 weeks, as the Spanish army was in no sense prepared to fight a war against the United States.

Treaty of Paris (1898)
----------------------

*"The Treaty of Paris of 1898 was an agreement made in 1898 that involved Spain relinquishing nearly all of the remaining Spanish Empire, especially Cuba, and ceding Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. The cession of the Philippines involved a payment of $20 million from the United States to Spain. The treaty was signed on December 10, 1898, and ended the Spanish–American War. The Treaty of Paris came into effect on April 11, 1899, when the documents of ratification were exchanged."*

— *[Wikipedia: Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281898%29)*

It was argued that the Philippines were not "racially capable" of self-governing. Racism played a significant role in the annexation of Philippines, and other regions.

*"White Man's Burden"*

*"I have studied attentively of the Constitution of the United States and I find in it no authority for colonies, and I have no fear"*
